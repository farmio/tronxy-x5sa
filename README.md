# Tronxy X5SA

Tronxy X5SA 3D printer findings and experience from a 3DP Newbie


## Introduction

Two friends bought theirself a 3D printer from AliExpress for 280â‚¬ to get into the matter. Some days passed until the package finally arrived. We were really excited to finally try our first test print. It took us about 5 hours to build it up according to the instructions were found on an included SD card.
When we powered on the machine for the first time we knew that this was just the beginning of our 3D printer assembly.
